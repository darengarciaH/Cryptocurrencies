# Cryptocurrencies
In this project, I process, analyze and group data to create a classification system of cryptocurrency investments. The source data required preprocessing before it could be fit into machine learning models. The output groups were unknown; therefore, an unsupervised model was selected to group the currencies. Visualizations were created to display the groups/clusters created from the machine learning algorithm.
